## Mile Pace

Given a number of miles ran, and a time in `"MM:SS"` (minutes:seconds) it took to run those miles, return a string for 
the average time it took to run each mile in the format `"MM:SS"`.

- Add leading **zeros** when needed.

### Tests

1. `mile_pace(3, "24:00")` should return `"08:00"`.
2. `mile_pace(1, "06:45")` should return `"06:45"`.
3. `mile_pace(2, "07:00")` should return `"03:30"`.
4. `mile_pace(26.2, "120:35")` should return `"04:36"`.
