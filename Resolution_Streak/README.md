## Resolution Streak

Given an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents a day of your resolution activities and contains three integers: 
the number of steps walked that day, the minutes of screen time that day, and the number of pages read that day; determine if you are keeping your resolutions.

 - The first sub-array is day 1, and second day 2, and so on.

A day is considered successful if all three of the following goals are met:

- You walked at least 10,000 steps.
- You had no more than 120 minutes of screen time.
- You read at least five pages.

If all of the given days are successful, return `"Resolution on track: N day streak."` Where `N` is the number of successful days.


If one or more days is not a success, return `"Resolution failed on day X: N day streak."`. 
Where `X` is the day number of the first unsuccessful day, and `N` is the number of successful days before the first unsuccessful day.

### Tests

1. `resolution_streak([[10500, 75, 15], [11000, 90, 10], [10650, 100, 9]])` should return `"Resolution on track: 3 day streak."`.
2. `resolution_streak([[10000, 120, 5], [10950, 121, 11]])` should return `"Resolution failed on day 2: 1 day streak."`.
3. `resolution_streak([[15000, 110, 8], [12300, 60, 13], [10100, 120, 4], [9000, 125, 4]])` should return `"Resolution failed on day 3: 2 day streak."`.
4. `resolution_streak([[11600, 76, 13], [12556, 64, 26], [10404, 32, 59], [9999, 44, 124], [7508, 23, 167], [10900, 80, 0]])` should return `"Resolution failed on day 4: 3 day streak."`.
5. `resolution_streak([[10500, 75, 15], [11000, 90, 10], [10650, 100, 9], [10200, 60, 10], [10678, 87, 9], [12431, 67, 13], [10444, 107, 19], [10111, 95, 5], [10000, 120, 7], [11980, 101, 8]])` should return `"Resolution on track: 10 day streak."`.
